# RISCV (RV32i) CPU Core

Accompanying resources for the [Building a RISC-V CPU Core](https://www.edx.org/course/building-a-risc-v-cpu-core) [EdX](https://edx.org/) course by [Steve Hoover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-hoover-a44b607/) of [Redwood EDA](https://redwoodeda.com), [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), and [RISC-V International](https://riscv.org).


Created a single cycle RISC-V Based Core that has 31 out of 47 instructions implemented in TL-Verilog

## Makerchip Studio IDE
Makerchip Studio is an online integrated development environment (IDE) for digital design, particularly focused on hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and SystemVerilog. It provides a platform for designing, simulating, and synthesizing digital circuits and systems. Makerchip Studio offers a range of features including code editing, waveform visualization, and interactive debugging, making it a comprehensive tool for FPGA and ASIC design.

## Learning outcomes of the Workshop
**Digital Logic Fundamentals:** The course lays the groundwork by introducing you to the basic concepts of digital logic, the building blocks of computer hardware. You'll learn about logic gates, their operations, and how they combine to create more complex circuits.

**RISC-V Architecture:**  You'll gain a solid understanding of the RISC-V architecture, a type of instruction set architecture (ISA) gaining traction in the hardware domain. This includes exploring the RISC-V instruction set and how it works.

**Building a Simple RISC-V CPU:**  The course gets practical by guiding you through the process of building a simplified RISC-V CPU core. You'll use modern circuit design tools and explore the Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) language for simulation purposes.
