# RISCV (RV32i) CPU Core

Accompanying resources for the [Building a RISC-V CPU Core](https://www.edx.org/course/building-a-risc-v-cpu-core) [EdX](https://edx.org/) course by [Steve Hoover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-hoover-a44b607/) of [Redwood EDA](https://redwoodeda.com), [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), and [RISC-V International](https://riscv.org).


Created a single cycle RISC-V Based Core that has 31 out of 47 instructions implemented in TL-Verilog

## Makerchip Studio IDE
Makerchip Studio is an online integrated development environment (IDE) for digital design, particularly focused on hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and SystemVerilog. It provides a platform for designing, simulating, and synthesizing digital circuits and systems. Makerchip Studio offers a range of features including code editing, waveform visualization, and interactive debugging, making it a comprehensive tool for FPGA and ASIC design.
